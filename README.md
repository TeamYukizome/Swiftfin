# Swiftfin Fork

## Information
This fork is exclusively for [building tvOS IPAs](https://github.com/TeamYukizome/Swiftfin/actions/workflows/ci.yml). Use it only for testing purposes or if you are experiencing issues with the App Store version.

## Notes
If the **Video Player Type** is set to **Swiftfin**, your video will not have controls and will not be in fullscreen mode. To resolve this, change the **Video Player Type** to **Native**.
